          Hi, I'm Liao Jianjian. I am a developer dedicated to learning latest
          programming tech for client-server architectures, all for creating
          awesome stuff and bringing positive impact on the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          I grew up in a small-town in Guangdong, southern China and went to
          school at Hunan University, graduating with a degree in Mechanical
          Engineering. After two years of work in vehicle industry, I went to
          Hong Kong and obtained my master degree in Mechanical Engineering in
          2017. The past two years I've learned and used JavaScript intensively
          to prepare myself for a career switch, and now I feel comfortable
          enough with modern web development workflow and am looking to become a
          fulltime web developer.

          I look pretty happy in the pictures right? Maybe sometime in the
          future I would become a fulltime sailor working at the sea (which is a
          parallel future with slim but non-zero chance to happen&nbsp;üòÇ), but
          before that, I think professional developer could be the second best
          choice for me to make a living and stay happy simultaneously&nbsp;üòé.
