          I am a self-employed software and web engineer dedicated to learning
          and teaching JavaScript for client-server architectures. After
          obtaining my Master's Degree in computer science, I gained experience
          from the startup world, where I used JavaScript intensively during
          both my professional life and spare time. Eventually it led me to
          teach others about these topics and to offer online courses and
          on-site consulting for companies. I am happy to welcome you on my
          website :-) hey there

          my personal intro here

          Hi! I am Tanay! I work at Microsoft. There are multiple Internet
          properties that I have created and you can find something interesting
          if you give a minute to read. I spend my time on the internet with the
          sole purpose of helping students land better jobs. If you’re a student
          and you don’t want to end up in service companies doing support job
          then you have landed in the right place.
